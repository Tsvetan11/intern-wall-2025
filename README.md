# 🧱 The Intern Wall

Welcome to the Intern Wall of 2025!

Every intern must carve their name and a fun fact onto the wall — but only through a Pull Request!

## 🕹️ Game Rules for Pull Requests

### ⚔️ Conflict Zone
- You **must** add your entry as number **3** — right below Bob.
- Do **not** change the numbering — just insert your line and bump others down.
- This will create intentional merge conflicts. Don’t panic — we’ll resolve them together!

### 👀 PR Review Challenge
- Another intern will review your PR before it’s merged.
- They will **leave 1 comment/suggestion** (e.g., reword your fun fact, formatting, etc.).
- You must **address the feedback** and push an updated commit before your PR can be approved.

### 🔁 Required Before Merge
- At least **1 approving review**
- All comments **must be resolved**
- The PR title should follow this format:  
  `Add [Your Name] to the Intern Wall`

## 🧰 Reviewer Guidelines

If you're reviewing a PR:
- Leave **one clear, kind suggestion** (spelling, formatting, or phrasing).
- Approve only when the change is addressed.
- Add a 🎉 emoji to your review when you approve!

🎉 When everyone has contributed and all PRs are merged, the Intern Wall will be complete!
